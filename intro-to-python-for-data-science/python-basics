1 When to use python?
All of the above

2 The Python Interface 
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Print the sum of 7 and 10
print(7 + 10)

3 Any Comments?
# Just testing division
print(5 / 8)

#Addition works too
# Addition
print(7 + 10)

4 Python as a calculator

# Addition
print(4 + 5)

# Subtraction
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication
print(3 * 5)

# Division
print(10 / 2)

5 Variable Assignment
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)

6 Calculations with variables
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4


# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = (monthly_savings * num_months)

# Add new_savings to your savings
total_savings = (new_savings + savings)

# Print total_savings
print(total_savings)

7 Other Variable types 
# Create a variable half
half = 0.5

# Create a variable intro
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Create a variable is_good
is_good = True

8 Guess the type
iPython Shell: 
type(a)
float
type(b)
str
type(c)
bool

Answer is: a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool

9 Operations with other types
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 12
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Calculate year_savings using monthly_savings and num_months
year_savings = (monthly_savings * num_months)

# Print the type of year_savings
print(type(year_savings))

# Assign sum of intro and intro to doubleintro
doubleintro = (intro + intro)

# Print out doubleintro
print(doubleintro)

10 Type conversion
# Definition of savings and total_savings
savings = 100
total_savings = 150

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(total_savings) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)

11 Can Python handle everything?
Which one of these will throw an error?
